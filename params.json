We present a framework for producing interpretable visualizations of CRI risk estimates obtained from multiclass machine learning models. Our approach can be used as a tool for a \"bird view\" of patients' risk characteristics, and support online monitoring and real time tracking of risk of CRI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Sliding Window View](https://youtu.be/xO1_cR2vxT8)\r\n\r\nThis video shows the risk state evolution with respect to risk esclation pattern (left plot) and risk drivers (right plot) during the patient's length of stay. The frames are sampled at a rate of once every 15 mins, with a sliding window size of 2 hours. Only data points with risk level over 0.5 are shown in the videos. \r\n\r\n\r\n## [Retrospective View](https://youtu.be/cHnLX1isSow)\r\n\r\nThis video demos visual tracking for retrospective analysis purpose. The video starts with a small window toward the end of patient's stay and gradually to include more data from the past as the video progress. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
